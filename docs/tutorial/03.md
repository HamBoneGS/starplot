title: 3 - Adding More Details to the Star Chart
---

---

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Tutorial - Detailed Star Chart](/images/tutorial/tutorial_03.png){ width="600" }
</figure>

Building on the first example, let's add some color and more objects to the plot, to create the chart above. Here's the revised code with the new lines highlighted:

```python  linenums="1" hl_lines="4 15-17  23-27"
--8<-- "tutorial/tutorial_03.py"
```

The first change you'll notice is specifying the `style` when creating the plot instance (line 15). This is an instance of a [`PlotStyle`][starplot.PlotStyle], and it represents ALL the styling properties to use for the plot (e.g. the colors, symbols, sizes, and more). In our revised example here, we create a default `PlotStyle` and then `extend` it with the `BLUE_MEDIUM` color scheme. Starplot has a very customizable [styling framework](/reference-styling) that allows you to customize the appearance of just about anything you plot.
